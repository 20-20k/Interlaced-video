# Interlaced-video
MATLAB code for working with interlaced video

This code works with interlaced video and explores ways to make it look better. 
It imports a video and splits it into frames. Due to this it can creat LOTS of files
so try smaller video clips.

It is currently for 24 fps video. This can be changed in the code, but it must match the video used.

The two methods are intra field and inter field interpolation.
